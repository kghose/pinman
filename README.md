# Pinman

Pinman is a puzzle game.

You are Pinman. You don't look like much, but you can move!

You can tumble right.

You can tumble left.

You can tumble up.

You can tumble down. 

Just don't tumble off the map!

Life isn't boring: You're trying to get somewhere.
See that green square? That's your exit. You have to move to it and
arrange yourself so you can drop right into it.

I wrote Pinman as a fun way to learn [golang](https://go.dev/). I'm
currently on a nostalgia trip, reliving my 8-bit C64/C128 days, so
this game looks a _bit_ like one of those 8-bit games.
